Common Issues:
  - array bounds
  - overflow
  - clearing structures in multitests (and between loops)
  - arithmetic between different things
    - eg. int +/- vector.size()
    - eg. int + int64_t

Sanity Reminders:
  - nothing is right until actually tested
  - write stress tests if going insane (maybe)
